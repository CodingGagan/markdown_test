## Tips for Getting the Most Out of the Essentials Summary Page<a id="tips-for-getting-the-most-out-of-the-essentials-summary-page"></a> ##

### Utilize Filters<a id="utilize-filters"></a> ###

Adjust the filters to focus on the most relevant data for your organization. For example, if you are only responsible for certain cloud accounts, filter out the others to avoid noise in your analysis.


### Monitor Savings Summary<a id="monitor-savings-summary"></a> ###

Regularly check the Savings Summary to track your progress. Aim to reduce the "Lost Opportunities to Date" and increase your "Net Savings %".


### Analyze the Total Savings Chart<a id="analyze-the-total-savings-chart"></a> ###

Use the Total Savings Chart to identify which types of opportunities are contributing most to your potential savings. If you notice a significant portion of your potential savings is coming from a specific category, consider diving deeper into that area for more opportunities.


### Act on Opportunities<a id="act-on-opportunities"></a> ###

Review the Opportunities Summary and prioritize the highest potential savings. Implement the recommendations for Idle Resources, EC2 Rightsizing, ASG Rightsizing, and Storage optimizations to maximize your savings.


### Schedule Regular Reviews<a id="schedule-regular-reviews"></a> ###

Set up a regular cadence (e.g., weekly or monthly) to review the Essentials Summary Page. This helps you stay on top of new opportunities and ensures that you are continually optimizing your cloud costs.
