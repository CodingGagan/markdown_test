This Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) for nOps.io services (the “Services”) sets forth the support service levels for every applicable nOps Subscription of Services. This SLA may be updated from time to time.

## Service request definitions: ##

- _Excused Downtime_ means the total number of minutes in the applicable month that the Services are unavailable due to downtime authorized by you.
- _Impact_ means the extent of deviation from the normal service level, in terms of the number of Users or business processes affected.
- _Issue_ means your communication to us via (i) a support ticket; (ii) an email addressed to support\@nops.io; or (iii) a telephone call to a designated customer success manager, of an unscheduled or unanticipated incident that adversely affects the delivery of the Services.
- _Required Monthly Availability _means the total number of minutes in the applicable month, minus the _Excused Downtime_, and _the Scheduled Downtime_.
- _Response_ means our action in response to notification from you to us of an Issue.
- _Scheduled Downtime_ means the total number of minutes in any given month that the Services are unavailable due to our scheduled maintenance and repair.
- _Support Request_ means a request made to us for the purpose of initiating our assistance for a support-related activity or _Issue_.



## Severity and Time-to-Respond ##

At nOps, we collaborate closely with our customers to ensure that any reported technical or business issues are given the appropriate level of priority. Our response times and the steps we take to resolve your problem are determined based on an evaluation of how the reported technical issue impacts your business. The more significant the impact on your business, the higher the priority assigned to the issue. This prioritization is crucial for our mutual success. It is a common understanding between both parties that the customer has the authority to specify the priority of their service request. When a request is marked as high-priority, a designated nOps customer success manager (CSM) will be at your disposal to assist while we work on resolving the issue. The following guidelines are provided to assist you in determining the appropriate priority level.

## Help Desk Support ##

We will provide the maintenance and support services set forth below as part of the nOps AWS marketplace subscription.

- Our support help desk (“Help Desk”) is available between the hours of 12:00am ET – 8pm ET Monday through Friday. Support is provided in the English language.

- We are available 24 hours per day 7 days a week for Severity Level 1 Issues (as defined under Paragraph 4.1).

- Support for Severity 1 issues during National Holidays or off-hours, between 8pm ET and 12AM ET, and weekends, requires a phone call to nOps’s designated CSM to engage support.

- You may create a Support Ticket by emailing nOps Help Desk at support\@nOps.io. For all valid nOps Subscriptions, you must create a Support Request for Severity 1, Severity 2, and Severity 3 issues. Registered users may create a Support Ticket by:

  - Submitting a Support Request at the **in-app** support chat directly.
  - Emailing the nOps Help Desk at support\@nOps.io.
  - Calling designated customer success manager (CSM).
  - Issues communicated to any other nOps.io person or entity, or from an unregistered person will be considered Severity 4 issues.
  - By submitting a Support Request, you are authorizing the nOps technical support team to download or copy any data necessary for troubleshooting the reported issue. If you have any concerns about this authorization, please contact your nOps CSM.
  - Communication directly with an account executive, project manager, engineer, or management contact is not covered by Issue Response and Resolution Times

### Issues Classification ###


| **Severity Level** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| Severity 1 | Customer cannot use most or all of a product or service (i.e., most pages in the product are not loading or displaying an error message). Data corruption or loss has occurred or will occur. |
| Severity 2 | Customer is prevented from executing one or more critical business processes (for example: Cloud Publishing, CCMS) for a substantial number of users, or Services are usable with limited capabilities and/or intermittent interruptions which have serious business Impact. |
| Severity 3 | Primary product functionality is severely impacted and unusable. Customers are unable to utilize a common feature to its fullest ability. Data may not be displayed as expected but is not lost. There is no commercially reasonable workaround for customers. |
| Severity 4 | Some customers (not all) are receiving intermittent errors on product pages or cannot use the product in possibly obscure ways. The product may be loading slowly or partially (missing images), and there is a workaround that customers can use. |


{%include note.html content=" When submitting a ticket customers should use their best judgment to identify the severity of the issue. For example, for a Severity 1 you need not confirm with each one of your users – a healthy sanity checks with a few different colleagues in different locations (to rule out local internet issues) is sufficient. Upon engagement nOps support team will evaluate the situation and may in its discretion reclassify an issue to the appropriate level." %}
