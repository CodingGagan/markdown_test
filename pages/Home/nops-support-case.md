## How to open a support case with nOps ##

nOps support team provides proactive support to all customers 12:00 am ET – 8:00 pm ET Monday through Friday.

Customers can also create a support case by themselves, track the constant progress, and track the current status of the ticket as we work towards providing the resolution.

### The steps to create a support case in nOps: ###

1. Login to your [nOps](https://app.nops.io/) tenant.
2. Click on our chatbot at the bottom right of the screen.

3. A pop-up box will expand with different support options. Click on “Send us a message” button

4. After clicking it will automatically start a conversation thread with multiple options to choose from. Select the most relevant option. (For the sake of this document we are selecting “_I want to submit a bug report_”)

5. Once you click on an option, ‘nOpsy the chatbot’ will ask you to brief the issue you want to report. > After you put a description in the chat it will ask you if you want to open a support ticket for the issue. > Click on the “Create Ticket” button if you want to log one.

6. The ticket is now logged and you will see the progress going forward in here too. A copy of this will be also sent to your email inbox.

7. You can visit the same chatbot and open tickets to see a list and status of all your support cases so far.

That’s how easy it is to create support cases within nOps. I strongly recommend using between 8:00 pm ET – 12:00 am ET as those are our non-working hours. Logging a ticket will get you a better and faster response as soon as a customer success manager comes online.
